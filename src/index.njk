<h2>What is Airyx?</h2>

<p>Airyx&trade; is a new open-source desktop operating system that aims to provide a similar experience and compatibiilty with macOS&reg; on x86-64 sytems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps. Airyx aims to feel sleek, stable, familiar and intuitive, handle your daily tasks, and provide as much compatibility as possible with the commercial OS that inspired it.</p>

<p>Airyx puts system things mainly into <code>/System</code>, <code>/Library</code>, and <code>/usr</code>. The <code>/usr/local</code> tree is reserved for user additions (like FreeBSD packages). User home directories are appropriately under <code>/Users</code>, and each has a <code>~/Library</code> folder for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit">Cocoa</a> apps to use. <code>Zsh</code> is the default system shell.</p>

<p>Properly packaged applications will typically live under <code>/Applications</code>
or <code>~/Applications</code> and are built as a <code>.app</code> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_(macOS)">Bundle</a> or as an
<a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>. Traditional
Unix-like applications are installed into fixed directories as usual. Airyx
provides an implementation of Cocoa (still incomplete) and modern Objective-C
runtime installed into <code>/System/Library/Frameworks</code>.
Compilers and linkers have been patched to support Frameworks, and the standard
<code>-F</code> and <code>-framework</code> arguments
work as expected.  Support for XCode project files is planned, but BSD-style
Makefiles are available today to easily build <code>.app</code>
and <code>.framework</code> Bundles. Swift is also on the
roadmap.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>If this sounds like your dream system, please help us make it a reality!
Hit us up at any of the links under <em>Connect with us!</em> #general on Discord,
#airyx on IRC and #airyx on Matrix.org are bridged together. More specific channels are
available on the Discord.</p>

<p>A Developer Preview image of Airyx is <a
href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/releases">currently available here</a>.
It's open to everyone, but is mainly intended for developers helping build the
system and is not ready for daily use yet. Running in a virtual machine is
recommended, although it should work on any hardware supported by FreeBSD
12.2 with at least 4GB RAM. (8GB is recommended.)</p>
