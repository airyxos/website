    <h1><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/releases/tag/0.3.0pre">0.3.0pre (Tanuki)</a></h1>
    <p><strong><em>This is an early Developer Preview release.</em></strong></p>
    <p><b>Tanuki</b> is the next iteration of Airyx. Major changes include:
    <ul>
        <li>A faster LiveCD boot that uses unionfs and does not require a ramdisk</li>
        <li>A new Airyx package repo which gets everything out of /usr/local. Nearly 1000 packages
            have been built with consistent paths like /System/Library/Fonts, /usr/lib and /etc.</li>
        <li>A LaunchServices framework</li>
        <li>Updated helloSystem <span class="code">Filer</span> integrated with LaunchServices and
        built as a real .app bundle in /System/Library/CoreServices/Filer.app. It has also been enhanced
        to properly extract icons and display names from .app bundles and AppDirs.</li>
        <li>A new desktop environment based on KWin and parts of KDE Plasma (work in progress))</li>
        <li>A "system" menu i.e. the persistent icon at the left of the global menu which provides global
        services like "About" and "System preferences"</li>
        <li>A real <span class="code">Terminal.app</span> (still QTerminal)</li>
        <li>Many bugs fixed.</li>
        <li>Many new bugs :)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Current Status (2021-09-03) - 0.3.0pre2</h2>
    <p>0.3.0pre gives a glimpse of the upcoming 'Tanuki' release which replaces the 'Atomic'
    proof-of-concept release. Although this is not ready for even developer use yet, enough people
    are looking at Airyx that I felt it was important to show the project direction.</p> 
    </p>The new LiveCD boot and package repo are implemented. Packages can only be installed from the
    Airyx repo at the moment, which does not have much beyond the essential system packages. It is possible
    to add the FreeBSD repo, but this may result in unwanted duplicate packages being installed in /usr/local
    and could break the system. The long-term plan is to package most software as bundles and AppDirs, and
    possibly to port Homebrew as an alternative package system.</p>
    <p>A mostly complete LaunchServices framework is available, providing the <span class="code">LS</span>
    and <span class="code">UTType</span> APIs.</p>
    <p>Filer has been repackaged into <span class="code">/System/Library/CoreServices/Filer.app</span>
    and modified to work with
    LaunchServices. It is not very useful yet since the LS database is minimal and there are no apps
    installed to open files. As it discovers .app bundles or AppDirs (i.e. you browse to their parent folder),
    the apps are added to the LaunchServices database.</p>
    <p>There is a <a href="images/airyx_0.3pre_splash.png">cute new splash screen</a> after login :)</p>
    <p>The desktop environment has been rebased onto a "minimal" KDE Plasma 5. KWin provides window management
    and plasmashell provides the top menu bar. This gives us the power of KDE's
    KF5 frameworks (not to be confused with Framework bundles) and services for implementing a powerful, smooth,
    and integrated desktop experience. You can run a command by invoking KRunner with Alt-Shift-F2 or Option-Shift-F2.
    Try running <span class="code">konsole</span>.</p>
    <p>An 'Airyx' menu (<img src="images/tree.svg" class="tinyicon"/> icon) has
    been added and the enabled items all work. Notably, choosing <em>>System Preferences</em>
    will invoke the KDE System Preferences panel until a more Mac-like panel can be implemented. Please try the
    <em>About This Computer</em> and report any issues with identifying your hardware.</p>
    <p>'Expos√©' also works - move your mouse to the top left corner.</p>
    <p>GUI elements and menu bar layout are now closer to a Catalina or Big Sur look</p>
    <p>Some system wallpapers have been added in <span class="code">/System/Library/Desktop Pictures</span></p>
    <p>Rust has been patched to support frameworks (untested)</p>
    <p>XDG directories are now in <span class="code">~/Library/FreeDesktop</span></p>
    <p>Updated to Python 3.8 + many other package updates</p>

    <h2>Bugs Fixed since 0.2.2</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/102">#102</a> Partial fix for the "Black Screen of Contention"</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/93">#93</a> No menu showing when desktop is selected</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/103">#103</a> 0.3.0pre1 Splash screens show 0.3.0pre</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/52">#52</a> Shared object "libAppKit.so" not found, required by "CocoaDemo"</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/50">#50</a> Up arrow key misinterpreted as a shortcut for Screenshot</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues/47">#47</a> Failing to boot in Vmware Fusion 12</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations and Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>See open Issues at <a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/issues">GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>There is no Dock or launcher panel</li>
    <li>Filer behavior is ... quirky</li>
    <li>Some icons are missing</li>
    <li>There are no real apps installed or available in the pkg repo. Notably there is no web browser yet.
    It is possible to build stuff from /usr/ports for now.</li>
    <li>The <span class="code">open</span> command is missing</li>
    <li>There is still contention between Plasmashell and Filer over who owns the desktop - but much improved from 0.3.0pre1</li>
    <li>'File open' dialogs may use KDE widgets or Filer (inconsistent)</li>
    <li>Cocoa apps do not update Recent Items yet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>To do before 0.3.0 release</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Package a terminal and web browser into /Applications - if not real .apps then at least wrappers</li>
    <li>Write <span class="code">open</span></li>
    <li>Populate the LS database at startup with apps in well-known locations - including parsing XDG's mime.list and other sources
    of filetype-to-app bindings</li>
    <li>Add some sort of Dock, either helloSystem's Dock or Latte Dock</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I hope to have this major update in a more usable state for daily development sometime in September, time permitting.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/releases/tag/v0.2.2">0.2.2 (Atomic)</a></h1>
    <p><strong><em>This is a Developer Preview release.</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        0.2.2 is the first build of Airyx based on the <a href="https://hellosystem.github.io/docs/">helloSystem</a> components
        and FuryBSD LiveCD installer. It introduced <span class="code">DBusKit</span> with preliminary support for 
        exporting NSMenus to the global menu bar over DBus and installs to a ZFS root.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Atomic series is built with standard FreeBSD packages in /usr/local and was slow to boot the LiveCD
        due to its need to copy the image to a ramdisk. These issues have been fixed for 0.3.0 (Tanuki).
    </p>
